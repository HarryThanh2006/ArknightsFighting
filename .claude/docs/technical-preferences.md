# Technical Preferences

<!-- project.yaml at the repo root is the machine-readable source of truth for
     engine, specialists, naming, performance, platform, and testing.framework.
     This file is the human-readable LEGACY FALLBACK: agents and skills resolve
     each key from project.yaml first and fall back here only when the
     project.yaml key is absent. /setup-engine dual-writes both.
     Forbidden patterns and allowed libraries are NOT migrated — they live only
     in this file. Populated by /setup-engine; updated as decisions are made. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Godot 4.7.2
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Rendering**: Forward+ (Godot 4 default; verify against `docs/engine-reference/godot/` before relying on renderer-specific features)
- **Physics**: Jolt (Godot 3D default). Not used by the combat sim: the fighting sim is custom and deterministic (fixed 60 Hz tick, hitboxes as per-frame data, no engine physics bodies or colliders in the sim)

## Input & Platform

<!-- Written by /setup-engine. Read by /ux-design, /ux-review, /test-setup, /team-ui, and /dev-story -->
<!-- to scope interaction specs, test helpers, and implementation to the correct input methods. -->

- **Target Platforms**: PC (Windows)
- **Input Methods**: Keyboard, Gamepad
- **Primary Input**: Keyboard (two players on one keyboard); gamepad supported from Tier 0
- **Gamepad Support**: Partial
- **Touch Support**: None
- **Platform Notes**: The sim reads one input struct per tick, never raw engine input. Default bindings put the two players on far-apart key clusters (keyboard ghosting risk); gamepad is supported from Tier 0. No motion inputs; direction + button combinations are allowed. LAN play (Tier 1) uses direct-IP UDP over Hamachi / Radmin; expect a Windows Firewall prompt on the host.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- **Variables**: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- **Signals/Events**: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- **Scenes/Prefabs**: snake_case matching the file (e.g., `player_controller.tscn`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60 FPS
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6 ms
- **Draw Calls**: 500 per frame (two fighters, one stage; outline pass roughly doubles character draw calls)
- **Memory Ceiling**: [TO BE CONFIGURED — set once target hardware is known]

## Testing

- **Framework**: gdUnit4
- **Minimum Coverage**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, gameplay systems, networking (if applicable)

## Forbidden Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should never appear in this project's codebase -->
- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

<!-- Add approved third-party dependencies here -->
- **gdUnit4 6.2.2** (`addons/gdUnit4/`, MIT) — test framework; installed by `/test-setup` on 2026-10-31

## Architecture Decisions Log

<!-- Quick reference linking to full ADRs in docs/architecture/ -->
- [No ADRs yet — use /architecture-decision to create one]

## Engine Specialists

<!-- Written by /setup-engine when engine is configured. -->
<!-- Read by /code-review, /architecture-decision, /architecture-review, and team skills -->
<!-- to know which specialist to spawn for engine-specific validation. -->

- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (all .gd files)
- **Shader Specialist**: godot-shader-specialist (.gdshader files, VisualShader resources)
- **UI Specialist**: godot-specialist (no dedicated UI specialist — primary covers all UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: godot-gdextension-specialist (GDExtension / native C++ bindings only)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for architecture decisions, ADR validation, and cross-cutting code review. Invoke GDScript specialist for code quality, signal architecture, static typing enforcement, and GDScript idioms. Invoke shader specialist for material design and shader code. Invoke GDExtension specialist only when native extensions are involved.

### File Extension Routing

<!-- Skills use this table to select the right specialist per file type. -->
<!-- If a row says [TO BE CONFIGURED], fall back to Primary for that file type. -->

| File Extension / Type | Specialist to Spawn |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Game code (.gd files) | godot-gdscript-specialist |
| Shader / material files (.gdshader, VisualShader) | godot-shader-specialist |
| UI / screen files (Control nodes, CanvasLayer) | godot-specialist |
| Scene / prefab / level files (.tscn, .tres) | godot-specialist |
| Native extension / plugin files (.gdextension, C++) | godot-gdextension-specialist |
| General architecture review | godot-specialist |
